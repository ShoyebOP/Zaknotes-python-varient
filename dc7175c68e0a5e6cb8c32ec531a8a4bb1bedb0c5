Task: Improve pipeline visibility and robustness. Summary: Added detailed logging to `ProcessingPipeline` and `AudioProcessor`. Updated `GeminiCLIWrapper` to capture raw bytes and decode using `errors='replace'` to avoid crashing on truncated multi-byte characters (like Bangla UTF-8 sequences). Why: To address user reports of poor visibility and encoding failures during large transcriptions.
