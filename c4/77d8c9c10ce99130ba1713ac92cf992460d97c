Task: Fix Client Initialization
Summary: Resolved TypeError in genai.Client initialization where 'config' was used instead of the expected 'http_options'. This was likely due to a breaking change in the google-genai SDK.
Files:
- src/gemini_api_wrapper.py (modified)
- tests/reproduce_issue.py (created)
Why: Restore transcription functionality that was failing due to SDK version mismatch/breaking change.
