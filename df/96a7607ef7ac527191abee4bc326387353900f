Task: Implement `TranscriptionService`. Summary: Created `src/transcription_service.py` to handle the logic of iterating through audio chunks, sending them to the Gemini CLI, and concatenating the results into a single transcript file. Implemented fail-fast error handling. Why: To coordinate the core transcription workflow.
